# Advent Of Code 2020

Here are solutions to the 2020 Advent Of Code problems in rust. Input text
files are in `res` to be replaced if desired, and days can be solved by running
`$ cargo run --release` (or without `--release` but it will be slightly slower).
rust's build tool [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) is of course required.
