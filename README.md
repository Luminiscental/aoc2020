# Advent Of Code 2020

Here are solutions to the 2020 Advent Of Code problems in rust. Input text
files are in `res` to be replaced if desired, and the script `run_day.sh` can
be used to run the solver for different days (e.g. `$ ./run_day.sh 1`). Of
course rust's build tool [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) is required
to build the project.
